# ToDoList

ToDoList is a guided project from Apples Develop in Swift Data Collections book.

ToDoList uses prior learnings from the Fundamentals and Data Collections books to create an app that allows users to manage and track their tasks. This is completed using a tableview, screens that allow user input for the tasks, and saving data to persist between app launches.
